Use at least 12 characters for your password.
Avoid common words, phrases, and personal information like your name, birthdate, or pet's name.
Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters for added complexity.
Consider using a passphrase (e.g., 'PurpleTreesRunFast!2023') instead of a traditional password.
Don't reuse passwords across different accounts.
Use a password manager to generate and store secure passwords.
Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra security.
Regularly update your passwords to prevent long-term exposure.
